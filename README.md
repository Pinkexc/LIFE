Lightweight Intermediaries For Exchange

Executive Summary 

Pinkexc turns purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies into an easy and straightforward process. What we do is simple; we operate an online trading platform, deploy cryptocurrency dispenser and conduct in-person bitcoin trades, and earn a profit by making a market. 

The Ipoh, Perak, Malaysian -based company was officially incorporated in July 2016. Currently, the firm operates an online trading platform 3 over the counter kiosk and 2 ATMs, in various locations. The two machines operate both ways, that is accept and dispense cash in exchange for crypto currency. 

Online marketplaces make purchasing cryptocurrency seems difficult and time consuming especially to new users. They all require a rigorous on-boarding process that requires even small-time buyers to divulge very personal information, such as government identification, bank statements, and social security number. It is a costly and time-consuming affair.

Pinkexc understands that not all customers can afford to wait or have the technical ability to understand what the manual says. Our registration requirements are straightforward, and our turnaround time is unparalleled. When our customers engage in an in-person transaction or use the ATMs, the cryptocurrency is sent to their wallet before they even have a chance to return to their car. 

Due to the convenience and speed that the company offers with regards to purchasing crypto, there has been immediate demand for our services. We have been able to grow very quickly because of our dedication to customer service, there are repeated demands for us to expand to new locations, and question on why we don’t advertise our service more. Our reason is, we are in development for the past one year, and capital is scarce for a start up like us.

Because cash is convenient for the user and carries extra risk/logistical issues for the vendor (us), we can charge a premium on the cryptocurrency that is purchased with bills. Currently, we charge 7% over the market value of crypto for each sell transaction, and 3.5% under the market value for each buy transaction. These are the lowest ATM fees in average comparison to other world operators.
 
Although it is hard to quantify the size of the cryptocurrency sector due to relative novelty, the space is quickly gaining traction in our society. It is still far from mainstream, yet as adoption continues to rise, so will Pinkexc’s transaction volume.

1. Overview of Pinkexc 

Crypto Market Space 
Cryptocurrency allows its owners to be their own bank, to quickly and inexpensively transfer their funds anywhere in the world, and to possess a transparent database that contains a record of every single transaction. This dynamic new ecosystem is rapidly proliferating with the rise of blockchain technology, and global adoption will only continue to grow. 
However, with the advent of a new digital asset class comes a set of new challenges. The creation of a decentralized system for smooth transactions is a central part of the general vision, but the exchange of different cryptocurrencies for fiat is still an integral part of the ecosystem today. The overall availability of different digital coins and tokens is low relative to its potential. 

At Pinkexc, we feel that this exchange of different coins (like bitcoin and ether) into fiat currency should be a seamless and intuitive process. We are an established company in the Malaysia that practice KYC (Know Your Customer) for high volume customers and our operations are in compliance to AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance protocols. Our goal is to create a regional network of cryptocurrency dispenser, that allow users to easily convert their highly-available fiat currency into relatively unobtainable digital assets (and vice versa). 

Convenience of Cryptocurrency Dispenser 
Acquisition of all cryptocurrencies primarily occurs on existing online exchanges. These exchanges often require users to link their bank accounts or other financial institutions in order to send funds to the market to execute orders. The verification process and mobility of these funds can take weeks, if not months. 

While the cryptocurrency dispenser network is not as expansive as the online exchanges, it does provide a location where users can take advantage of a quick registration process and the convenience of being able to exchange cash for cryptocurrencies in a matter of minutes. 

Organically Growing the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem 
Speed, convenience of acquisition, and a fair price are three sought-after components of cryptocurrency exchanges. In order to increase general awareness and encourage mass adoption, these facets need to be optimized. 
These are core values at Pinkexc as we are actively trying to expand the crypto dispenser network across the region and maybe eventually, the globe. People should be able to make bitcoin and other cryptocurrency purchases without hassle and time constraints. The easier it is to freely exchange fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa, the faster the overall crypto sphere will grow.

2. Business Model 
Core Components 
The business model at Pinkexc is centred around exceptional customer service, low fees, and the simple user interface of our machines. There are other dispensers on the market, but they are intimidating to users and are difficult to use. In addition, the charges are unreasonable, sometimes in excess of 16%. 

There are two dispensers that we normally being deploy. The majority are small one-way machines that accept fiat cash in exchange for the corresponding crypto amount, which is sent immediately to the customer’s wallet address. The second is a larger two-way machine that allows people to buy or sell cryptocurrencies for fiat cash. 

ATM Design 
Our primary ATM design specification are: 
	A small outer shell comprised of durable metal 
	A simple grey stand that the ATM is bolted on top of 
	A tablet-like screen that has an integrated user interface 
	A state of the art validator that quickly accepts fiat cash 
	A camera that makes it easy to verify customer identities 
	And it must be a two-way machine is a single unit with multiple recyclers that allows users to sell their crypto to Pinkexc. 

Terminal Software & Transaction Process 
The user interface is easy to use. This is critical in a space that is often criticized for being too complex for the average consumer. Users are prompted through a quick registration and the registration is tied to a user’s primary phone number. Using the KYC module on the machine itself, the user is then able to scan his or her QR address code and insert bills of any denomination into the ATM. After the user is finished inserting each individual bill, he or she is prompted to confirm the total amount. The corresponding value in crypto will be automatically sent to his or her wallet address. 

Backend Server Protocol 
Every registration will be manually review and approved by a Pinkexc associate. We take our compliance program extremely seriously and run all of the verification checks that are required. User information gathered during the registration process are stored on a secure server, and never sold to a third party.

6. LIFE Value & Discounted Transaction
LIFE can be used for trading as well as to pay for any fees on PINKEXC platform. This fee is converted into PINKEXC terms and paid in LIFE as follows: 

•	The fee percentage is set by PINKEXC. It will differ by liquidity of the assets (e.g. BTC-LIFE will have a lower fee than BTC-ETH), as well as possibly by trade size and/or token holdings. As volume throughput of the platform increases over time, fees will likely go down as PINKEXC negotiates better terms with the exchanges to reduce the transaction fees that the trade execution fees cover.
•	The fee is assessed at the time of order submission; the percentage fee is converted from Sell Asset terms to LIFE terms using the current mid-market price (derived from exchanges).
•	The fee is collected at the time of order submission; if the trade is cancelled, the fee is retained.
•	If the member does not have enough LIFE (or chooses this path), they will be prompted with the option to purchase the required tokens from PINKEXC in exchange for a value-equivalent portion of the Sell Asset being used in the order. 

Discounted Transaction
To incentivize loyal use of the platform and accrual of usage tokens for future trading, PINKEXC platform usage costs are discounted for consistent and significant members. 

•	The discount level, i.e. the amount by which fees are discounted, is proportional to how long the volume and frequency of transaction.

With discounts, this allows early members who plan to use the platform more often in the future and for larger volume of transaction to be rewarded for that. They also can refer their friends and families and either opted to have be rewarded with LIFE tokens, or access to larger daily transaction volumes at a lower cost.

7. Regulatory Compliance
Given the scale and importance of PINKEXC, the PINKEXC team is working to ensure that the platform is in complete compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. We are working with lawyers as well as trade bodies in trying to meet legal and regulatory requirements. 
For the good of the development of the crypto space, we hold compliance and openness toward regulators as the utmost priority and wish to be a model for other services in the space. We expect and welcome engagement and cooperation with regulators in the future. 

8. How to Participate in PINKEXC LIFE Token Swap
The best - perhaps only - way for protocols and platforms to succeed in this new decentralized financial system is to build a community around them, and PINKEXC is no exception to this rule. We invite engagement and dialog on our business model, our token model, and our design. We view our role in the markets as providing a service for the public in general and for the unbanked and those that been left out of the unfair financial system.



9. Conclusion
The cryptocurrency domain has evolved within the recent years, bringing into fruition a great variety of sites with all sorts of cryptocurrency services, similar to one another, and very limited in terms of functionality. However, the analysis of the cryptocurrency users' behaviours has indicated that many of them are looking for a unified medium allowing to manage multiple crypto in one place, as well as comprising the principles of the educational websites, the wallet providers, the rankings and the exchanges.

Such a platform, compatible with multiple sites, products and services in relation to cryptocurrencies, designed to perform various business deals can significantly change the way most cryptocurrencies are operated at the present moment. The paradigm shift initiated by innovations like Bitcoin, Ethereum and the Distributed Ledger Technology can be taken a step further to boost the massive adoption of digital currencies, and to stabilize the role of this pioneering market in the global economy by providing a better user experience. This is the main idea behind PINKEXC and the LIFE project. 

PINKEXC aims to consolidate and gain the like-minded cryptocurrency users (customers, merchants, enthusiasts, developers, businesses, start-ups, investors, traders, etc.) on board around a user-friendly and intuitive platform that can seamlessly integrate all the existing features under the same structure.

This platform comprises an exchange, two-way crypto to fiat dispenser, debit card, a marketplace and a foundation for crypto community development, but of course is not limited to these functions only. 

PINKEXC offers an entirely new customer and merchant experiences to its users, who can be businesses and consumers at the same time. PINKEXC allows building further applications upon its foundation, and thus, growing and expanding infinitely, driven by the customers’ demands and the rapidly-evolving market. 

The customers of the PINKEXC platform are people from all walks of life with various needs and interests. Such a versatile community is a great source of inspiration for the non-techie users willing to use cryptocurrency and to benefit from it in the long-run, and increasing the merchants’ conversion rates as they grow in number.
